# City of Truro Mariners - Management Console
A2 Computer Science coursework for the City of Truro Mariners Model Boat Club

API is closed source as it handles payments therefore has private keys etc

And yes my commit messages are canerous xD if I was working in a team they would be nicer but im only working on my own so it doesn't really matter

I know what I'm doing:tm:

# Documentation:

If your OS is not supported you can build the app for your OS!:

1. Install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Clone or download the repository (if using zip extract the zip file)
3. Change into the folder that was cloned/extracted
4. Open a terminal and run `npm install`
5. Then run `npm build` for window, or `npm run-script build` for linux or for macOS `npm run build`
6. Then change into the dist directory on windows you will have an exe, on mac a dmg and on linux an appimage file

On Windows you can just run the exe, on macOS you can run the dmg and install it, on linux you must do this (below is an example for version 1.0.26 on arm64):
1. Then to give the AppImage the correct permissions like so `sudo chmod a+x ./The\ City\ Of\ Truro\ Mariners\ -\ Management\ Console-1.0.26-arm64.AppImage`
2. Then run this `./The\ City\ Of\ Truro\ Mariners\ -\ Management\ Console-1.0.26-arm64.AppImage --no-sandbox`

If you get an error you may need to look here as keytar may need to be rebuilt:
