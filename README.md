# City of Truro Mariners - Management Console
A2 Computer Science coursework for the City of Truro Mariners Model Boat Club

API is closed source as it handles payments therefore has private keys etc

I had no idea what RPC, Pug.js/Jade.js or EJS was when I made this therefore it doesn't use these things and therefore the coding isn't the greatest but it's secure fast and it works (most of the time) :P

# All pull requests should be pushed to dev not main
