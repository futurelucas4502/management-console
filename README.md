# All pull requests should be pushed to dev not main

The above image references the [dev branch](https://github.com/futurelucas4502/management-console/tree/dev) whereas the [main branch](https://github.com/futurelucas4502/management-console/tree/master) is always stable/passing so is safe to download and build from.

A2 Computer Science coursework for the City of Truro Mariners Model Boat Club

API is closed source as it handles payments therefore has private keys etc
